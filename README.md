# Object-Oriented Programming

## Abstract
This repository contains exercise codes for the Object-Oriented Programming discipline carried out in the C++ and Java languages.

## Goals
- **Object-oriented programming concepts**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and dynamic linking are important concepts for carrying out projects.
- **Code organization and reuse**: OOP allows you to organize code more intuitively, making it easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.
- **User experience**: OOP contributes to a more consistent and less bug-prone user experience.

## Tools
- **IDEs (Integrated Development Environments)**: Some environments such as Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Dev C++ were used to facilitate visualization.
- **Command prompt**: Using the terminal to compile codes.
